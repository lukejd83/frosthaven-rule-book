# Frosthaven Rule Book

This is a ligthweight, searchable, version of the Frosthaven Rule Book, inspired by https://github.com/m-ender/gloomhaven-rules. 

**Since I do not want to spoil myself this will not contain any of the stickers until we unlock them.**

### Stickers added:

- Sticker 4
- Sticker 10
- Sticker 15

I've made a separate document that only lists the parts of the Rule Book that are marked as [new in Frosthaven.](./new-to-frosthaven.md)

All text taken from the original Rule Book (as uploaded to https://github.com/any2cards/worldhaven). Icons taken from https://github.com/any2cards/worldhaven. All mistakes are mine. PR's welcome, **as long as they do not contain spoilers.**
